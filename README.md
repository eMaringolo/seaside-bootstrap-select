# seaside-bootstrap-select
Seaside integration (canvas, plugin and options) of Bootstrap-Select (https://github.com/silviomoreto/bootstrap-select) plugin


# Simple use

To use it, send `tbsSelect` instead of `select` to the HTML canvas.

```smalltalk

  html tbsSelect
    list: Object subclasses
```

# More examples

There is a `Bootstrap-Select-Examples` package that autoinitializes a browser application at `/boostrap-select` of your default Seaside dispatcher.
